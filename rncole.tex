\section*{Objective}
I am a senior civil design engineer with a Senior Reactor Operator Management Certification, more than five years experience in engineering design and corrective action program management, and more than ten years of information technology experience. I am seeking to utilize my unique skillset and plant understanding in a supervisory or management role.  Specific areas of interest include plant design, operations, and nuclear construction with opportunities to take on unique or challenging roles.

\section*{Professional Experience}
\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
2012--pres.&{\bf Senior Civil Design Engineer at \fontsize{12}{12}\textsc{Tennessee Valley Authority}}\\
&Ensured engineering schedule adherence as a member of the Engineering Rapid Response Team at the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant by providing engineering expertise to Operations and other plant organizations.  Primary responsibilities included production of design change requests, temporary alterations, and engineering input and oversight.  Secondary responsibilities included continued ownership of Cranes and Rigging (including NUREG-0612, Control of Heavy Loads), representing Watts Bar and Engineering at Nuclear Regulatory Commission meetings related to flood mode at their headquarters in Washington, DC, and support of IBM Cognos reports.\par\vspace{0.5em}

I was selected for a Pressurized Water Reactor Senior Reactor Operator Management Certification in October 2012.
% Comment from Kevin: Take the below description out depending on audience - leave in for outside of nuclear. 
This certification required 7 months of a rigorous training program that included NRC Generic Fundamentals requirements of Components, Reactor Theory, and Thermodynamics, 3 months of PWR plant systems, and 2 months of main control room operator simulator training at the TVA Sequoyah Nuclear Plant.

2010--2012&{\bf Engineering Corrective Action Program Manager at \fontsize{12}{12}\textsc{Tennessee Valley Authority}}\\
&Manager of the Corrective Action Program (CAP) and Performance Improvement functions for the Watts Bar Engineering organization.  Interfaced with other plant organizations to coordinate corrective action program functions including the corrective action program, trending reviews, benchmarking, and self assessments. Acted as the engineering representative for the CAP problem screening committee by providing technical insight and guarding the design basis of the plant, and chaired the Engineering Departmental Corrective Action Review Board to ensure quality CAP products.\par\vspace{0.5em}

Developed reporting tools for use within engineering as well as the site for management of CAP health and integration between the CAP and work management software by providing interfacing managers with key information to ensure that they could meet their goals and deadlines using IBM Cognos reporting authoring tools.\par\vspace{0.5em}

Guided the Engineering program at Watts Bar toward excellence in CAP.  This was evidenced by engineering CAP program health improving from consistently poor performance at Yellow and Red to the best sustainable performance in the previous decade at White to Green with continuous improvement.\\[10pt]
