&Progressively increasing responsibility to leadership and oversight of a multi-discipline team of field engineers within Balance of Plant (BOP) - Standard Plant and Nuclear Island for V. C. Summer Units 2 and 3.  Structures within scope include Nuclear Island, Annex Building, Transformer Pad, Radwaste and Diesel Generator buildings.  Additional responsibilities included coordination of design changes between site and corporate engineering as well as integrating lessons learned from the Vogtle 3 and 4 project.  
\\[6pt]

2012--2013&{\bf Senior Civil Design Engineer at \fontsize{12}{12}\textsc{Tennessee Valley Authority}}\\
&Ensured engineering schedule adherence as a member of the Engineering Rapid Response Team at the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant by providing engineering expertise to Operations and other plant organizations.  Primary responsibilities included production of design change requests, temporary alterations, and engineering input and oversight.  Secondary responsibilities included engineering ownership of Cranes and Rigging, and support of IBM Cognos reports. \par\vspace{0.3em}

In an interim role, developed a new site external flood protection program including procedures, inspection requirements, and acceptance criteria to ensure that the site remains in compliance with regulatory requirements, the plant design basis, and ensuring compliance with post-Fukushima regulatory orders.  
% Comment from Kevin: Take the below description out depending on audience - leave in for outside of nuclear. 
%This certification required 7 months of a rigorous training program that included NRC Generic Fundamentals requirements of Components, Reactor Theory, and Thermodynamics, 3 months of PWR plant systems, and 2 months of main control room operator simulator training at the TVA Sequoyah Nuclear Plant.
